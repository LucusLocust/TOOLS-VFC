TOOLS-VFC
=========

Slightly updated legacy code base for Visual Flow Coder tools (circa 1999) for WIndows.  Updated for Visual Studio 2013 compliation, Win 7/8, multiple monitors, and new support for *.vfc file type.

These tools will have several related branches.  Since I am still learning GITHUB these branches may end up merging into multiple new trunks and may be setup later as new repositories.
